                <h1>Sri Lanka Tea Plantation</h1>
        <p>
            Not long after the British occupied the Teardrop Isle in the early 19th century, they realised Sri Lanka's highlands were ideal for growing tea. Plantations were terraced into the mountainsides, factories and rudimentary accommodations built for pickers, and a rail network engineered to transport leaves down to Colombo. The stretch of line between Kandy and Ella is considered one of the most beautiful in the world <br>

            Tea remains a significant part of the Sri Lanka's economy - they call it "green gold". And over the last decade, it's become a significant feature on holiday itineraries. The most popular plantations to visit are those around Nuwara Eliya, Kandy and Ella, where a cool, misty climate makes for excellent growing conditions. <br>

            Sri Lanka is one of only a few countries where tea is still plucked by hand, from bushes planted along the contours of the slopes. A highly skilled workforce, predominantly Tamil women, moves along rows of bushes, stripping two leaves and a bud from each plant and often covering over 10km in a day. After picking, the leaves are immediately carried to the nearby factories where they are dried, processed and packed into crates ready for transportation.
