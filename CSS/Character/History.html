            2,000 years ago, in his previous life, Anos was an orphan. Humans killed his mother while she was pregnant with him and he was born from her corpse. He said that it was something he could never forget.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the war, Anos battled and destroyed various enemies, as he encountered the Hero Kanon on the battlefield and the two began to battle, with Kanon managing to injure Anos a fair degree while Anos would destroy all but a single of Kanon's seven sources, thus forcing Kanon to retreat. The two would continue to meet and battle each other during the Great War, as both gained an unspoken mutual respect for each others power and determination.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the war between humans, spirits, gods, and demons raged on, Anos eventually grew tired of the constant fighting and decided that the only way peace could be achieved was by building walls between the four races, hoping they would forget their grudge after a thousand years or so. Thus he formed an agreement with the Hero Kanon, Great Spirit Reno, and the Goddess of Creation Militia, whom he invited to his castle Delsgade and sacrificed himself to supply enough magic for the cause, saying that he would reincarnate after 2,000 years.
        </p>
        <p>
            The unborn child which Anos would reincarnate into, was close to death while still inside his mother's womb. Because the doctors couldn't do anything, even with magic, Izabella prayed every day for her child to be born. It didn't matter to her which divine or demonic being answered, so long as they'd help her child. While she was sleeping, the baby's heart stopped inside of her. Izabella's prayers were finally answered when the child's heart started beating again. Little by little, the unborn child regained his strength and grew as Anos' source chose the unborn child to reincarnate in, thus returning life to it. He believes that it was because of his mother's sheer force of will that he was drawn to the baby.
